- **Python:** Version 3.6 or higher (This application comes with everything you need, so you don’t have to worry about installing Python separately.)

## 📑 Features
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Groups images without needing labels.
- **K-means Clustering:** Uses efficient algorithms to find patterns.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Measures how similar the images are based on their visual features.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for anyone to use easily, without technical knowledge.

## 🖥️ Running the Application
After installation, follow these steps to run the application:

1. Open the application by clicking its icon.
2. Look for an option to upload your flower images. Click on it and choose the images you want to cluster.
3. After uploading, click on the "Cluster Images" button to start the process.
4. Wait a moment as the application processes the images. Once done, you will see the images grouped by similarity.

## 📊 Understanding the Results
Once the clustering is complete, the application will show the results in groups. Here’s how to understand what you see:

- Each group contains images that are similar.
- You can click on the groups to view the images together.
- Use these results to organize or analyze your flower collection more efficiently.

## 📝 Troubleshooting
If you run into any issues, consider the following tips:

- Ensure your images are in standard formats like JPEG or PNG.
- Restart the application if it doesn’t respond.
- Check that your computer meets the system requirements mentioned above.
- For technical assistance, visit the Issues section in the GitHub repository.
